Just# Hello-World
This is my first repository
Just as the first time I learn Java and C,the first program i created was named as hello world.
I am a still freshman in programming even I have learnt programming for 2 years in that GitHub will be both helpful and challenging for me.The first challenge is the language......Maybe I know every words,but the sentence and the total meaning are hard to understand.It takes me much time to read and understand.What's more,the most important function——searching codes,how to search the coes I need??!!It almost makes me crazy......
The learning journey will be long and difficult.
However,they will be defeated!
